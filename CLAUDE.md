# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a clean, newly initialized Git repository with no existing codebase or project structure. The repository is currently empty except for the `.git/` directory and this CLAUDE.md file.

## Project Structure

The repository is completely empty and ready for new project initialization. When starting development, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the appropriate project structure based on the technology stack
2. Set up package management files if needed (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Create the main source code directories
4. Configure any necessary build tools or development environments

## Development Commands

Since this is an empty repository, no build, test, or lint commands are currently configured. These will need to be established based on the chosen technology stack and project requirements.

## Git Configuration

The repository is initialized with Git and has a clean working directory. The main branch is ready for development.
